Given the large volume of the original Chinese restaurant data and the fact that the core computations are not centered around the raw data, we consider the process of generating flows from the original data as data processing rather than the method itself. Therefore, we have not uploaded the raw data but have provided the processed symbolic flow data(see symbolicflows).
In symbolicflows, ODflow_len, ODflow_azi, ODflow_int correspond to the fields of length, azimuth angle, and intensity, respectively.
